## Installation

Simply run this line to install the package using PIP
```shell
pip install -e git+https://github.com/EQ15T/photon-catalysis.git#egg=photon_catalysis
```

## Usage Example
Using this software, one could obtain the set of linear forms in annihilation operator, such that their product,
upon conditioning, corresponds to the desired core state. For exmaple, for the state 
$$ \ket{\psi} \propto \ket{2000} + \ket{0200} + \ket{0020} + \ket{0002} $$
the following code could be used:
```python
from photon_catalysis.utils import kets_to_state_dict
from photon_catalysis.optimal_preparation import optimal_preparation

extra_photons = 2
state = kets_to_state_dict([(2, 0, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0, 2)])
for W, prob, fid in optimal_preparation(state, extra_photons, num_decompositions=10):
    print(W)
```

Rows of `W` define the linear forms, `extra_photons` is the number of catalysis photons.
